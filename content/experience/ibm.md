As part of an elective called Industrial SCRUM Master Training during my masters, I worked as a SCRUM master in collaboration with a development team of bachelor students. The premise was to work for a client following the SCRUM principles.

We managed to impress the IBM representatives so that they picked our group to work on their project.

Here I gained a wide variety of experiences in both enterprise development and Agile development. The project itself focused on IoT and usability, where I gained much insight through the development team.
