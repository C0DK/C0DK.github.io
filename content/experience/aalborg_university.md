# Expanding and migrating microservice ML project
My bachelor project was a multi-project composed of approximately 30 students who worked together on a project running for 4 years, the aSTEP project, AAU's Spatio-TEmporal data analytics Platform. It would continue to run for years to come.

I was headhunted by the Semester Coordinator, who wanted me to finish the different open-ended tasks and improve different aspects of the system to prepare for future semesters and prepare for conferences where the project would be presented.

I was the primary visionary on the system's architectural design, which was built on the micro-service pattern. I was rather proud of how it helped the cooperation and created a stable, extensible and modular system.
