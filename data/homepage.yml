  subtitle: "Senior Data Engineer"
  description: >
    Located in Aalborg, Denmark ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡° with my wife and our daughter.
    We live in a big 100 year old house that I somehow convinced myself i would be able to renovate myself.
    It's going alright.
    I apply my software engineering background in the data world by day,
    and write all sorts of software and open source contributions by night.
    I love software, but also plants, nature ðŸŒ³, hikes, cargo bikes and books.
